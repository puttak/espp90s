# Harvard ESPP 90S Final Project - Spring 2020

## Summary

An feasibility study of onshore wind powered clean ammonia production based in northwestern Michigan. The idea is to generate liquid ammonia as a means of flattening the sporadic and peaky wind power curve, and then sell this ammonia as a carbon free fuel. This repo contains a basic economic analysis implemented in a Jupyter notebook.
